## Joint Trajectory

trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory

1. **Header** ([std_msgs/Header](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/Header.html))

   - `stamp`: The timestamp associated with this trajectory.
   - `frame_id`: String used for multi-robot systems. In most single-robot setups, this is usually left empty.

2. **Joint Names** (`string[] joint_names`)

   - A list of names for joints. The order of the names defines the order of the `positions`, `velocities`, and `effort` arrays in the `JointTrajectoryPoint` messages described below.

3. **Points** ([trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectoryPoint[\]](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/trajectory_msgs/html/msg/JointTrajectoryPoint.html) `points`)

   - An array of trajectory points, where each point represents a snapshot in time with positions, velocities, accelerations, etc., for each joint. Each 

     ```
     JointTrajectoryPoint
     ```

      has the following structure:

     - `float64[] positions`: Positions for each joint at this point in the trajectory. The order corresponds to the `joint_names` order.
     - `float64[] velocities`: Velocities for each joint. If left empty, they might be ignored or treated as zero by some controllers.
     - `float64[] accelerations`: Accelerations for each joint. Often used for trajectory optimization but not always required.
     - `float64[] effort`: Efforts (forces or torques) for each joint. Not always used, but can be important for some robots or controllers.
     - `duration time_from_start`: Time since the beginning of the trajectory that this point should be reached. This determines the timing or speed of the trajectory execution.



## Joint Trajectory Controller

1. **/joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory**:
   - **Purpose**: This is typically the topic to which you send `JointTrajectory` messages to command the robot to move. The controller listens to this topic and then attempts to make the robot follow the specified trajectory.
   - **Type**: `trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory`
2. **/joint_trajectory_controller/controller_state**:
   - **Purpose**: This topic provides detailed feedback about the state of the controller. It gives information like the current position, velocity, and effort of each joint, as well as the desired position, velocity, and effort set by the trajectory. This information can be used for debugging, monitoring, or other control purposes.
   - **Type**: `control_msgs/JointTrajectoryControllerState`
3. **/joint_trajectory_controller/state**:
   - **Purpose**: It's somewhat common in ROS-based systems for controllers to provide a simpler state feedback on a separate topic. While `controller_state` gives detailed feedback, this topic might provide more condensed information about the current state of the robot, perhaps just the positions or velocities of the joints. The exact nature of the feedback can vary.
   - **Type**: Depending on the setup, it could be `sensor_msgs/JointState` or another type that provides joint-level state information.
4. **/joint_trajectory_controller/transition_event**:
   - **Purpose**: This topic is used to inform other nodes or systems about lifecycle transition events of the controller. ROS2 introduced the concept of [managed nodes (or lifecycle nodes)](https://design.ros2.org/articles/node_lifecycle.html) that have different states like `unconfigured`, `inactive`, `active`, etc. When the controller transitions between these states, it can send a message on this topic.
   - **Type**: `lifecycle_msgs/TransitionEvent`

For practical applications:

- If you want to command the robot to move, you'd interact with the `/joint_trajectory_controller/joint_trajectory` topic.
- If you want to monitor how well the robot is tracking the desired trajectory, you'd listen to `/joint_trajectory_controller/controller_state`.
- If you're building systems that need to be aware of the lifecycle state of the controller, you'd listen to `/joint_trajectory_controller/transition_event`.
